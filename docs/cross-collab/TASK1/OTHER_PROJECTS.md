# Other Projects — Task 1

Repo: TRR-APP  
Last updated: February 9, 2026

Cross-Repo Snapshot
- TRR-Backend PR `#44` merged.
- TRR-APP PRs `#18` and `#19` merged.
- SCREENALYTICS PR `#187` merged.
- Code/CI is complete across repos; staging + production rollout smoke is complete (including DB side effects).
- Task 1 is complete for contract scope. Task 2 tracks show-level SYNC (not implemented here).

Scope Clarification (Task 1 vs Task 2)
- Task 1 (completed; contract scope): seed flagging + `seed_only` contract + strict fallback + episode-level import side effects.
- Task 2 (tracked separately): show-level SYNC endpoint + UI + orchestration (not part of Task 1 closeout).

Locked Contracts (No Pending Changes)
1. Backend toggle endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/admin/person/{person_id}/gallery/{link_id}/facebank-seed`.
2. Toggle payload: `{ "facebank_seed": boolean }`.
3. Toggle response: `{ "link_id": string, "person_id": string, "facebank_seed": boolean }`.
4. Screenalytics photos endpoint: `GET /api/v1/screenalytics/people/{person_id}/photos?seed_only={bool}`.
5. Service auth for app proxy path: `Authorization: Bearer <service_role>` + `X-TRR-Internal-Admin-Secret`.
6. Screenalytics must use `served_url` and strict fallback: only call `seed_only=false` after successful empty `seed_only=true`.

Addendum (Admin Media Enhancements)
- TRR-Backend calls the people-count endpoint; ensure `/vision/people-count` is reachable at `SCREENALYTICS_API_URL` (TRR-Backend side).
- If TRR-Backend is configured with an incompatible path, set `SCREENALYTICS_API_PATH=/vision/people-count` (TRR-Backend) rather than changing SCREENALYTICS routing.
- Backend preview (`POST /api/v1/admin/scrape/preview`) may include `images[].bytes` for UI display (best-effort).
- Backend import kind allowlist includes `promo`, `intro`, `reunion` in addition to existing kinds.
- People Count auto-count falls back to source URL when `hosted_url` is missing.
- Cast Photos imports (kind=`cast`) auto-fill people tags + caption from scraped per-image context text.
- Cast Photos imports store article publish date as `metadata.source_created_at` so UI shows **Created**.
- Season Media “Add backdrops” drawer only shows TMDb backdrops not already assigned to any season for the show.
- Admins can delete unified media assets (`DELETE /api/v1/admin/media-assets/{asset_id}`) via TRR-APP proxy + UI actions.

Responsibility Alignment
- TRR-Backend
  - Owns `core.media_links.facebank_seed` schema + view exposure.
  - Enforces allowlist-only admin auth and scoped service-role + internal-secret auth for toggle endpoint.
- TRR-APP
  - Owns admin UI toggle and proxy route.
  - Must forward `Authorization` service-role token and `X-TRR-Internal-Admin-Secret`.
  - Must require allowlisted admin access before proxying.
- SCREENALYTICS
  - Owns seed-first fetch behavior and strict fallback logic.
  - Uses `served_url` and persists rows through `import_facebank_images`.

Operational Findings (Completed)
1. Targeted regression suites passed in all repos.
2. Backend local auth guard behavior verified (`403`, `403`, `200`).
3. Backend local `seed_only=true/false` subset behavior verified.
4. Strict fallback request sequence observed in backend logs.
5. Production TRR-APP proxy route verified end-to-end (allowlisted admin).
6. Production backend auth guard verified (service role requires internal shared secret).
7. Production `seed_only` contract verified (seeded subset vs non-seeded superset).
8. SCREENALYTICS `sync_cast_from_trr` import hook verified (seeded + unseeded) with `import_errors=0`.
9. SCREENALYTICS DB side effects verified (`face_bank_images` inserts + dedupe).

Open Operational Risks / Blockers
- None.

Dependency Order (For Final Closeout)
1. Deploy TRR-Backend (`main`, includes PR `#44`).
2. Deploy TRR-APP (`main`, includes PR `#18/#19`).
3. Deploy SCREENALYTICS (`main`, includes PR `#187`).
4. Run staging full smoke and DB side-effect checks.
5. Roll production in same order and run minimal smoke.
6. Mark all Task 1 docs completed only after both environments pass. (Now complete as of February 6, 2026.)
