# Other Projects — Task 1

Repo: TRR-APP  
Last updated: February 6, 2026

Cross-Repo Snapshot
- TRR-Backend PR `#44` merged.
- TRR-APP PRs `#18` and `#19` merged.
- SCREENALYTICS PR `#187` merged.
- Code/CI is complete across repos; rollout smoke is still in progress.

Locked Contracts (No Pending Changes)
1. Backend toggle endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/admin/person/{person_id}/gallery/{link_id}/facebank-seed`.
2. Toggle payload: `{ "facebank_seed": boolean }`.
3. Toggle response: `{ "link_id": string, "person_id": string, "facebank_seed": boolean }`.
4. Screenalytics photos endpoint: `GET /api/v1/screenalytics/people/{person_id}/photos?seed_only={bool}`.
5. Service auth for app proxy path: `Authorization: Bearer <service_role>` + `X-TRR-Internal-Admin-Secret`.
6. Screenalytics must use `served_url` and strict fallback: only call `seed_only=false` after successful empty `seed_only=true`.

Responsibility Alignment
- TRR-Backend
  - Owns `core.media_links.facebank_seed` schema + view exposure.
  - Enforces allowlist-only admin auth and scoped service-role + internal-secret auth for toggle endpoint.
- TRR-APP
  - Owns admin UI toggle and proxy route.
  - Must forward `Authorization` service-role token and `X-TRR-Internal-Admin-Secret`.
  - Must require allowlisted admin access before proxying.
- SCREENALYTICS
  - Owns seed-first fetch behavior and strict fallback logic.
  - Uses `served_url` and persists rows through `import_facebank_images`.

Operational Findings (Completed)
1. Targeted regression suites passed in all repos.
2. Backend local auth guard behavior verified (`403`, `403`, `200`).
3. Backend local `seed_only=true/false` subset behavior verified.
4. Strict fallback request sequence observed in backend logs.

Open Operational Risks / Blockers
1. Staging + production rollout smoke has not yet been executed end-to-end.
2. Required local/env secrets are not fully configured for full live-path proxy and ingest verification.
3. SCREENALYTICS local persistence DB lacks required tables (`person`, `face_bank_images`) on current `DB_URL`.

Dependency Order (For Final Closeout)
1. Deploy TRR-Backend (`main`, includes PR `#44`).
2. Deploy TRR-APP (`main`, includes PR `#18/#19`).
3. Deploy SCREENALYTICS (`main`, includes PR `#187`).
4. Run staging full smoke and DB side-effect checks.
5. Roll production in same order and run minimal smoke.
6. Mark all Task 1 docs completed only after both environments pass.
